title: Craig Palsson's Research
---
My work focuses on how institutions such as property rights and state capacity evolve in developing countries. A lot of this work looks at institutions in Haiti, contributing to our limited knowledge of its economic history.

Another branch of my work looks at the effects of the rapid adoption of smartphone devices and apps. This work includes research on how children get injured more because their parents are on smartphones and Uber’s effect on public transit.
